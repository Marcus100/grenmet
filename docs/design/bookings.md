# Barrels Bookings

Public booking pages at `/{business}` and the staff studio at `/studio`. Both
use the shared Barrels foundation tokens from `@barrelsgd/ui/styles/globals`
(the same layer as `barrels.md`). The shared semantic classes (`bg-background`,
`text-foreground`, `text-muted-foreground`, `border-border`, `bg-primary`,
`ring-ring`) are the only colour route in components; the values above restate
them for agents. Source of truth: `packages/ui/src/styles/globals.css`.
Light mode only for v1.

Do not use the GMS `--gm-*` palette from `@barrelsgd/gms`. That palette is the
Grenada Meteorological Service brand, and a Barrels product must not inherit it.
This spec names the palette `colors` above only because the CSS-drift test
checks each value against the shared globals.

## Principles

- **The business leads.** On a public booking page the tenant's business name is
  the page title and the first thing read. Barrels appears as a small
  "Booking by Barrels" credit in the footer, never in the header or as the
  heading. The tenant's logo, when one exists, sits beside the name.
- **Booking is one task.** Each step has one question: pick a service, pick a
  time, give your details, confirm. Show the chosen service and time in a summary
  on every later step, and keep the primary action in the same place.
- **Say what is open, not only what is closed.** A business with no online
  booking shows "Online booking is not open for this business yet." A slot that
  was just taken says so and offers the next free time. Never show a bare
  "unavailable".
- **Colour has jobs.** Navy (`primary`) = the one primary action on a page.
  `focus` = keyboard focus rings and large links only (its contrast on white is
  4.16, below AA for small text). `positive` and `negative` only with a word
  next to them ("Confirmed", "Cancelled"), never colour alone.
- **Phone first on public pages.** 375 px is the reference width. Targets are
  44 px or more. `/studio` is desktop-first with a usable phone layout for the
  day's agenda.

## Layout

- Public pages: one column up to `max-w-2xl`, the business header on top, the
  step content, then the footer with the credit and a link to the business's
  own contact details.
- Studio: a left navigation (agenda, services, hours, settings) on desktop; a
  top tab row on phones. The signed-in name sits in the header with Sign out.
- Spacing follows the shared scale (`spacing.unit` 4 px). Section gaps are
  `section-y` (40 px) on public pages.

## Contrast (WCAG 2.1)

ink/paper 17.74, secondary/paper 7.56, muted/paper 4.83, muted/surface 4.52,
primary/paper 16.88, paper/primary 16.88, negative/paper 5.81, positive/paper
4.81. Small text uses ink, secondary or muted only. `focus` (4.16 on paper) is
for rings and text of 18 px or more. `sky` is decorative and never carries
text on paper.

## States

- **Loading:** a polite `role="status"` line, never a spinner alone.
- **Error:** a short sentence with the next step ("Try a different time"),
  linked to the field with `aria-describedby`. The live region is `role="alert"`.
- **Not open:** the public copy above. No payment wording until deposits exist.
- **Empty studio:** say what to set up first, with a link. Never hide the
  section.

## Type

Inter for everything (`font-sans`, loaded in `src/app/layout.tsx`). Headings use
`font-semibold` or `font-bold`; body is 16 px on public pages so it reads well
on a phone, 14 px is allowed in dense studio tables. `display` is the
business-name heading only.
