# Design Critique

`/ui-check` compares an implementation against a reference. This does the opposite job: it judges a surface **on its own terms** when there is no canvas to compare against — "this looks off and I don't know why."

Load [`refactoring-ui`](../refactoring-ui/SKILL.md) before starting. Every finding must trace to a named principle in it; a critique you cannot attribute is taste, not review.

## Step 1 — Get the subject

You need one of:

- a screenshot (pasted or attached), **or**
- a component/page file path, **or**
- a published Claude Design canvas URL

and the intended viewport (375px mobile, 1280px desktop, or both).

Ask for the app if the path does not make it obvious — the lane changes the verdict. `gms` is the public reference app and should read spacious; `gaa-admin` is deliberately dense and must not be critiqued into looking like a marketing page; `wxproducts` and `hr` are fixed-dimension document/print surfaces where A4 constraints outrank white-space advice.

Do not proceed on a described-from-memory surface. If there is no screenshot and no file, ask the user to run the app on the host (see `docs/ports.md`) and screenshot it.

**Done when:** you have the subject, the viewport, and the app lane.

## Step 2 — Read the surface before judging it

Write down, in one or two lines each:

- What is this screen for, and what is the single most important thing on it?
- What is the one primary action?
- What content is secondary, and what is tertiary?

This is the yardstick for everything that follows. A hierarchy finding is only meaningful against a stated intent.

**Done when:** the primary element, the primary action, and the demoted content are each named. If the surface does not have an obvious primary element, that is itself finding #1.

## Step 3 — Walk the ladder in order

Work rungs 1→7 from the `refactoring-ui` ladder, loading each chapter file as you reach it. **Do not skip ahead** — a spacing complaint on a page with broken hierarchy wastes the user's attention on the wrong fix.

At each rung, record findings as:

| Field | Content |
|---|---|
| Rung | hierarchy / spacing / type / colour / depth / images / finish |
| Observation | what is actually on screen, concretely |
| Principle | the named rule it violates, e.g. "Emphasise by de-emphasising" |
| Fix | the specific change, expressed in existing tokens or utilities |

Stop descending when you have 3–4 findings on the top two rungs — fixing those changes everything below, and a critique with twenty items gets ignored. If the top rungs are clean, keep going to the finish rung.

**Done when:** every rung above your stopping point has been examined and either produced findings or been explicitly cleared.

## Step 4 — Make every fix token-legal

For each fix, resolve the value onto what already exists:

- type → a `text-*` step and its paired `leading-*` (`packages/ui/src/styles/globals.css`)
- colour → a semantic token (`text-muted-foreground`, `bg-warning-soft`), or a `--gm-*` GMS brand colour on GMS surfaces (`packages/gms/src/styles/foundation.css`)
- spacing → Tailwind's own scale
- elevation → `shadow-card`
- radius → `rounded-*`

Any fix that needs a value with no token is **a separate, flagged line item**: a token request for the user to approve, not something to write inline. Say so explicitly rather than substituting the nearest token and staying quiet about it.

**Done when:** every fix is either expressible in existing utilities or flagged as a token request.

## Step 5 — Report, ranked

Present findings **most-impactful first** — which after step 3 means roughly ladder order. For each: the observation, the principle, and the fix.

End with:

- the two or three changes that would do most of the work, if the user only makes a few
- any token requests, listed separately
- anything you could not judge from the material given (interaction states, empty states, dark mode, real data at volume)

**Do not edit any files in this step.** The critique is the deliverable.

## Step 6 — Apply, if asked

Only on the user's go-ahead, and only the findings they name. Then:

```bash
pnpm design-system:check
pnpm fix && pnpm type-check
```

Before declaring done, grep for other consumers of anything you touched — a shared primitive in `@barrelsgd/ui` reaches every app, and `gaa-admin` alone fronts cap, hr, wxwatch, wxproducts and salesbus. Report what the search surfaced; do not silently widen the edit.

**Done when:** the approved findings are applied, the three commands pass, and the blast radius is reported.
