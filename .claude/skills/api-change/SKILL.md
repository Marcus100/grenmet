description: Propagate a FastAPI route/schema change to the generated TypeScript client and API docs. Use when editing apps/api/fastapi/src/**/router.py, routes.py, schemas.py, or routers/, or when a web app needs a field/endpoint @barrelsgd/api-client doesn't have yet.

# FastAPI Contract Change

This is the procedure the repo's own Blast-Radius Gate table names in one
cell ("A FastAPI route or schema → regen `openapi.json` → `pnpm
generate:api-client` → `pnpm check:drift`; `docs/api/contracts.md`") — this
skill is that cell, spelled out. `packages/api-client/src/gen/` is Never-tier
(mechanically blocked by `.claude/hooks/protect-files.mjs`) — you cannot hand-edit
around this procedure even if it would be faster.

## When this applies

Any edit under `apps/api/fastapi/src/**/router.py`, `routes.py`, `schemas.py`,
`schemas/`, or `routers/` (the same file patterns
`scripts/guardrails/check-blast-radius.mjs` treats as FastAPI contract files),
or `apps/api/fastapi/src/main.py`. Also applies in reverse: a web app needs a
field or endpoint `@barrelsgd/api-client` doesn't expose yet.

Adding or modifying a **public** route, or anything that changes the OpenAPI
contract, is Ask-First per `AGENTS.md` — confirm with the user before starting,
not after.

## Procedure

1. **Make the FastAPI change** (route, schema, or model) in
   `apps/api/fastapi/src/`.
2. **Regenerate `openapi.json`** (from `apps/api/fastapi`):
   ```bash
   uv run --frozen --package fast-back python -c "from src.main import app; import json; json.dump(app.openapi(), open('openapi.json', 'w'), indent=2)"
   ```
3. **Regenerate the TypeScript client** (from repo root):
   ```bash
   pnpm generate:api-client
   ```
4. **Verify no drift**:
   ```bash
   pnpm check:drift
   ```
   A failure here means step 2 or 3 was skipped or produced something
   inconsistent — fix forward, don't hand-edit `packages/api-client/src/gen/`
   to make drift-check pass.
5. **Update `docs/api/contracts.md`** if the change is a new endpoint, a
   breaking field change, or anything else that document already describes.
6. **Update every consumer** of the changed types/endpoints across the web
   apps — grep for the generated hook/client function name
   (`@barrelsgd/api-client`'s generated names follow the FastAPI
   operation ID). This is the Blast-Radius Gate step; `pnpm guardrails:staged`
   only checks that the contract-file change and a client regen both happened,
   not that every consumer was updated.
7. **Commit `openapi.json` and the generated client changes together** (per
   `docs/api/contracts.md`) — never split them across commits.

## Verification

- `pnpm check:drift` passes.
- `pnpm type-check` passes (a removed/renamed field surfaces here across every
  consuming app).
- `pnpm guardrails:staged` passes (checks the contract-file/client-regen
  pairing mechanically).
- Every consumer found in step 6 is updated, or explicitly reported to the
  user per the Scope Gate if it's outside what was asked.

## What NOT to do

- Don't hand-edit anything under `packages/api-client/src/gen/` — it's
  Never-tier and mechanically blocked.
- Don't regenerate the client without first regenerating `openapi.json` — the
  client would just re-encode the stale contract.
- Don't skip `docs/api/contracts.md` for a breaking change because "the code
  is the source of truth" — the doc is what the next agent (or the next
  session of you) reads before touching this surface again.
