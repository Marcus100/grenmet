Rate limiting for auth and sensitive endpoints.

- Login, password-recovery, and reset-password are rate limited (e.g. 5–10/minute per IP).
- Returns 429 Too Many Requests when the limit is exceeded.
- Uses in-memory storage per process. For multi-instance deployments,
  configure a shared store (e.g. Redis) via the limiter's storage backend.
